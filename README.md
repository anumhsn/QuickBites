### App Description
- This application showcases a list of NYC restaurants, ordered by food category. Uses CRUD functionality for a REST API.

### Feature List
- This app is geared towards an individual who doesn't know what they want for lunch/dessert, or wants to find a new cafe to grab coffee from. The app is super simple so the user can just look at the options and decide quickly. User can also add/edit/delete restaurant options.


### Technologies Used
- This app will be built with a ruby on rails backend, and a react front end. 

### MVP
- App will show at least 4 categories as the landing page. Clicking on each category will show all the restaurants from that category, with one restaurant taking up the entire screen. If the user clicks yes, more info is shown about the restaurant. If no, then another restaurant is automatically shown. User can also add/edit/delete restaurants.
